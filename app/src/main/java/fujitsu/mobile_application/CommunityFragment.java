This is one of the year-end activities initiated by the Philippines GDC employees to engage and be involved with the Community as part of the Global Responsible Business Program.Weeks prior to the handing over of donations, a creative idea spearheaded by the GDC's Ophie Indiongco is the building of \"Giving Christmas Trees\" out of all the materials for donation.Representatives from the Holy Foundation visited the GDC. Dressed in red dresses, the girls expressed their gratitude through a a medley of songs and dances before being toured around the Net Square and Eco Tower offices at Bonifacio Global City Taguig." ,
